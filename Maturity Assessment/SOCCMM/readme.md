# MODEL
The SOC-CMM model was created by evaluating scientific and non-scientific literature to determine characteristics and features of SOCs, such as specific technologies or processes. These characteristics and features were then aggregated into respective domains. Then, a survey was held among SOCs to determine the existence of identified theoretical elements in practical situations. The outcome of that survey, combined with the initial literature review and augmented with literature review on maturity models was used to create the SOC-CMM model. The model is shown to the left. The model consists of 5 domains and 25 aspects. The domains 'Business', 'People' and 'Process' are evaluated for maturity only (blue colour), the domains 'Technology' and 'Services' are evaluated for both maturity and capability (purple colour).
# MATURITY Levels
The SOC-CMM uses maturity stages based loosely on the CMMI:  
- Non-existent. At this level, the aspect is incomplete  
- Initial. The aspect is delivered in an ad-hoc fashion  
- Defined. The aspect is documented and delivered consistently  
- Managed. The aspect is managed using ad-hoc feedback on the quality and timeliness of deliverables  
- Quantitatively Managed. The aspect is systematically being measured for quality, quantity and timeliness of deliverables  
- Optimizing. The aspect is continuously being optimized and improved  
  
Contrary to the CMMI, the SOC-CMM is a continuous maturity model. Thus, improvement is continuous and can be done on all aspects simultaneously and independently.
### CAPABILITY
The SOC-CMM uses a continuous approach to measuring technical capability across the technology and services domains. These can be technical features, such as the existence of certain tooling options or other features such as service artefacts. Just like with maturity scoring, capability scoring is continuous. Similar to the CMMI, the SOC-CMM supports 4 capability levels:  
- Incomplete  
- Performed  
- Defined  
- Managed  

Capabilities can be expressed at any maturity level. Thus, capabilities do not depend on maturity levels and can be improved independently.
### METHODOLOGY
The methodology used to create the SOC-CMM is a scientific research approach called [Design Science Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_science_research). This type of research has a focus on bridging the gap between theory and practice and works well for areas that have not been extensively (scientifically) studied and clearly defined, as is the case for SOC capability and maturity. The goal of Design Research is the creation of a tangible result of the research effort. In this case, two artefacts were created: the SOC-CMM model, which is an abstract representation of SOCs and the self-assessment tool based on that model to evaluate capability maturity in a SOC.
## Assessments Available

 - SOC-CMM basic assessment tool - The basic assessment tool contains the full SOC-CMM assessment and is the recommended option for most users
 - SOC-CMM advanced assessment tool - The advanced assessment tool allows for prioritizing individual questions and is recommended only for experienced users of the SOC-CMM
 - SOC-CMM for CERT assessment tool - The SOC-CMM for CERT is a version of the SOC-CMM that is aimed specifically at assessing maturity in incident response teams
 - SOC-CMM SOC Target Operating Model tool
 - SOC-CMM to NIST CSF mapping - The SOC-CMM ouput sheets also provide insigfht into how well the SOC is scoring on the NIST CSF framework.
