## BRMM Maturity Scoring Logic:

This maturity scoring is based on a total score of 26 and assigns organizations to one of four maturity levels based on their score. Maturity Level 1 (Initial) corresponds to a score of 0-6 points, indicating that the organization has an immature backup and recovery program. Maturity Level 2 (Repeatable) corresponds to a score of 7-13 points, indicating that the organization has some basic backup and recovery capabilities in place that are repeatable and consistent. Maturity Level 3 (Defined) corresponds to a score of 14-19 points, indicating that the organization has a well-defined backup and recovery program that is aligned with business needs and risk management objectives. Maturity Level 4 (Managed) corresponds to a score of 20-26 points, indicating that the organization has a mature backup and recovery program that is actively managed and continuously improved against evolving cyber threats and business needs.

  

Total possible score: 26

-   Maturity Level 1 (Initial): 0-6 points
    
-   Maturity Level 2 (Repeatable): 7-13 points
    
-   Maturity Level 3 (Defined): 14-19 points
    
-   Maturity Level 4 (Managed): 20-26 points
## Additional Recommendations

In addition to the recommendations provided earlier, here are some other factors that organizations should consider when assessing and improving their backup and restoration capabilities:

  

-   Backup Frequency: Determine the frequency of backups based on the criticality of the data and the RTO. Critical data may require more frequent backups to ensure a faster recovery in the event of a cyber incident.
    
-   Backup Storage: Consider the location and security of backup storage. Backup data should be stored in a secure and remote location to prevent it from being impacted by a cyber incident affecting the primary storage location.
    
-   Backup Retention: Determine the appropriate backup retention period based on the organization's business needs, compliance requirements, and data retention policies. Ensure that backups are retained for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery from a cyber incident.
    
-   Backup Encryption: Consider encrypting backup data to protect it from unauthorized access or theft. Encrypted backups can provide an additional layer of protection against cyber threats.
    
-   Backup Redundancy: Consider implementing backup redundancy to ensure that backup data is available and recoverable in the event of a failure or loss of the primary backup storage.
