## Backup and Recovery Maturity Assessment

The BRMM questionnaire is a set of questions designed to assess the maturity of an organization's backup and restoration capabilities against best practices and industry standards. The questionnaire is divided into six sections, each focused on a specific aspect of backup and restoration capabilities:

  

Backup Strategy: This section focuses on whether the organization has a documented backup strategy in place that includes procedures for backup and restoration in the event of a cybersecurity incident or ransomware attack. The questions in this section also assess whether the backup strategy has been tested for effectiveness and whether it is regularly reviewed and updated to ensure it remains effective against evolving cyber threats and business needs.

  

Backup Procedures: This section focuses on whether the organization has documented backup procedures that are followed by all personnel responsible for backups. The questions in this section also assess whether backup procedures are regularly reviewed and updated to ensure they remain effective against evolving cyber threats and business needs, and whether backups are performed at regular intervals and stored in secure and isolated locations.

  

Backup Testing: This section focuses on whether the organization regularly tests backups to ensure they are functioning correctly and can be restored in the event of a cybersecurity incident or ransomware attack. The questions in this section also assess whether test results are documented and used to improve backup and restoration capabilities against evolving cyber threats and business needs, and whether backups are tested against specific cyberattack scenarios.

  

Restoration Procedures: This section focuses on whether the organization has documented restoration procedures that are followed by all personnel responsible for restoring data. The questions in this section also assess whether restoration procedures are regularly reviewed and updated to ensure they remain effective against evolving cyber threats and business needs, whether personnel are trained on restoration procedures, and whether there are specific procedures in place for restoring data in the event of a ransomware attack.

  

Data Recovery Time Objective (RTO): This section focuses on whether the organization has a documented RTO for restoring data in the event of a cybersecurity incident or ransomware attack. The questions in this section also assess whether the RTO is achievable and aligned with the organization's business needs and risk management objectives, whether it is regularly reviewed and updated, and whether there is a specific RTO for restoring data in the event of a ransomware attack.

  

Backup and Restoration Monitoring: This section focuses on whether the organization has a system in place to monitor backups and restorations for potential cybersecurity incidents or ransomware attacks. The questions in this section also assess whether logs and alerts are reviewed regularly, whether there is a process in place to address and resolve any issues identified through monitoring, and whether monitoring is used to improve backup and restoration capabilities against evolving cyber threats and business needs.

Each question in the questionnaire is assigned a point value based on whether the organization answers "Yes" or "No." These point values are then used to determine the organization's maturity level for each section, ranging from Maturity Level 1 (Initial) to Maturity Level 4 (Managed). Recommendations are provided for each section to help the organization improve its backup and restoration capabilities and move to a higher maturity level.

## Maturity Levels

The BRMM is divided into four maturity levels:

  

-   Maturity Level 1 (Initial): An organization at this level has an ad hoc backup and restoration program that lacks structure and consistency. There may be some backup procedures in place, but they are not coordinated or integrated into a cohesive program.
    
-   Maturity Level 2 (Repeatable): An organization at this level has established some basic backup and restoration procedures that are repeatable and consistent. However, these procedures may not be well-documented or fully integrated into a formal backup and restoration program.
    
-   Maturity Level 3 (Defined): An organization at this level has a well-defined and documented backup and restoration program that is aligned with business needs and risk management objectives. Backup and restoration procedures are fully integrated and regularly reviewed and updated.
    
-   Maturity Level 4 (Managed): An organization at this level has a mature backup and restoration program that is actively managed and continuously improved against evolving cyber threats and business needs. There is a culture of backup and restoration awareness throughout the organization, and backup and restoration procedures are regularly tested, audited, and updated.

## BRMM Maturity Scoring Logic:

This maturity scoring is based on a total score of 26 and assigns organizations to one of four maturity levels based on their score. Maturity Level 1 (Initial) corresponds to a score of 0-6 points, indicating that the organization has an immature backup and recovery program. Maturity Level 2 (Repeatable) corresponds to a score of 7-13 points, indicating that the organization has some basic backup and recovery capabilities in place that are repeatable and consistent. Maturity Level 3 (Defined) corresponds to a score of 14-19 points, indicating that the organization has a well-defined backup and recovery program that is aligned with business needs and risk management objectives. Maturity Level 4 (Managed) corresponds to a score of 20-26 points, indicating that the organization has a mature backup and recovery program that is actively managed and continuously improved against evolving cyber threats and business needs.

  

Total possible score: 26

-   Maturity Level 1 (Initial): 0-6 points
    
-   Maturity Level 2 (Repeatable): 7-13 points
    
-   Maturity Level 3 (Defined): 14-19 points
    
-   Maturity Level 4 (Managed): 20-26 points
## Conclusion
By considering these factors and implementing best practices in backup and restoration, organizations can improve their resiliency against cyber incidents and minimize the impact of any potential disruptions.
