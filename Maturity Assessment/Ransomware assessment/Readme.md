The Ransomware Control Matrix (RCX) is a cybersecurity framework that was developed by Edgar Rojas and Aria Rahimi of Tata Consultancy Services in 2022. It is designed to help organizations defend against ransomware attacks by providing a comprehensive set of controls that can be implemented to reduce the risk of such attacks.
The RCX is unique in that it maps the tactics and techniques used by ransomware attackers to both the MITRE ATT&CK framework and the MITRE D3FEND framework, which allows for a more holistic approach to cybersecurity.
The RCX is divided into three categories: Foundational, Advanced, and Elite. Each category contains a set of controls that organizations can implement to improve their ability to detect and respond to ransomware attacks. The controls within each category are designed to be flexible and adaptable to an organization's specific needs and risk profile.
