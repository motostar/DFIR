# Introduction
The Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model (C2M2) can help organizations of all sectors, types, and sizes to evaluate and make improvements to their cybersecurity programs and strengthen their operational resilience. This report presents the results of a C2M2 self-evaluation. The results included in this report may be used to measure and improve an existing cybersecurity program. It also may serve as an input for other activities, such as informing cybersecurity risk managers about the controls in place to mitigate cybersecurity risks within an organization.
# Model Architecture
The model is organized into 10 domains. Each domain is a logical grouping of cybersecurity practices. The practices within a domain are grouped by objective—target achievements that support the domain. Within each objective, the practices are ordered by maturity indicator levels (MILs).
## Domains, Objectives, and Practices
The C2M2 includes 356 cybersecurity practices, which are grouped into 10 domains. These practices represent the activities an organization can perform to establish and mature capability in the domain. For example, the Asset, Change, and Configuration Management domain is a group of practices that an organization can perform to establish and mature asset management, change management, and configuration management capabilities.

The practices within each domain are organized into objectives, which represent achievements that support the domain. For example, the Asset, Change, and Configuration Management domain comprises five objectives:

1.  Manage IT and OT Asset Inventory
2.  Manage Information Asset Inventory
3.  Manage IT and OT Asset Configurations
4.  Manage Changes to IT and OT Assets
5.  Management Activities for the ASSET domain
## Maturity Indicator Levels
The model defines four maturity indicator levels (MILs), MIL0 through MIL3, which apply independently to each domain in the model. The MILs define a dual progression of maturity: an approach progression and a management progression.

Four aspects of the MILs are important for understanding and applying the model:

-   The maturity indicator levels apply independently to each domain. As a result, an organization using the model may be operating at different MIL ratings in different domains. For example, an organization could be operating at MIL1 in one domain, MIL2 in another domain, and MIL3 in a third domain.
-   The MILs—MIL0 through MIL3—are cumulative within each domain. To earn a MIL in a given domain, an organization must perform all of the practices in that level and its predecessor level. For example, an organization must perform all of the domain practices in MIL1 and MIL2 to achieve MIL2 in the domain. Similarly, the organization must perform all practices in MIL1, MIL2, and MIL3 to achieve MIL3.
-   Establishing a target MIL for each domain is an effective strategy for using the model to guide cybersecurity program improvement. Organizations should become familiar with the practices in the model prior to determining target MILs. Then, they can focus gap analysis activities and improvement efforts on achieving those target levels.
-   Practice performance and MIL achievement need to align with business objectives and the organization’s cybersecurity program strategy. Striving to achieve the highest MIL in all domains may not be optimal. Companies should evaluate the costs of achieving a specific MIL versus its potential benefits. However, the model was designed so that all companies, regardless of size, should be able to achieve MIL1 across all domains.
## Maturity Indicator Level Scoring
MIL achievement scores are derived from responses entered into the C2M2 Self-Evaluation Tool. Responses are chosen from a four-point scale: Fully Implemented (FI), Largely Implemented (LI), Partially Implemented (PI), and Not Implemented (NI). A MIL is achieved when all practices in that MIL and all preceding MILs receive responses of Fully Implemented or Largely Implemented. A MIL is not achieved if any practices in that MIL or a preceding MIL have received a response of Partially Implemented or Not Implemented.

In other words, achieving a MIL in a domain requires the following:

1.  Responses of Fully Implemented or Largely Implemented for all practices in that MIL
2.  Responses of Fully Implemented or Largely Implemented for all practices in all preceding MILs in that domain

For example, to achieve MIL1 in a domain with four MIL1 practices, all four MIL1 practices have responses of Fully Implemented or Largely Implemented. To achieve MIL2 in that same domain, all MIL1 and MIL2 practices must have responses of Fully Implemented or Largely Implemented.

|  Response| Implementation Description |
|--|--|
|  Fully Implemented (FI)|Complete  |
| Largely Implemented (LI) | Complete, but with a recognized opportunity for improvement |
| Partially Implemented (PI) | Incomplete; there are multiple opportunities for improvement |
|  Not Implemented (NI)| Absent; the practice is not performed by the organization |
## C2M2 Self-Evaluation Tools

Two C2M2 self-evaluation tools are available. 
 - A downloadable PDF-based tool 
 - HTML-based tool. [Tool Link](https://c2m2.doe.gov/c2m2-assessment)
Self-evaluation data can be saved and loaded into either tool. In other words, you can save a self-evaluation performed using the PDF-based tool and upload it into the HTML-based tool or vice versa.
